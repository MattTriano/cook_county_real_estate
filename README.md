# Cook County Real Estate Data

Chicago and its surrounding suburbs seem exceptionally insulated from the harms of climate change. Lake Michigan ensures perpetual access to fresh water. The great elevation above sea level (just under 600 ft above sea level) coupled with the extreme value of fresh water ensure there will always be ways to prevent Chicago from flooding. The vast population essentially assures there will be reliable utilities and a large enough tax base to fund any necessary public works, not to mention insuring the cultural output and culinary options will remain robust. LA and NYC are both increasingly unaffordable cities facing increasing threats from hurricanes and wildfires respectively, while Chicago is comparativley extremely affordable. 

Given the above, planting roots in the Chicago metropolitan area seems like a proposition worth investigating, and thanks to Chicagoland's incredible open data environment, there's plenty of data to work with.

In this repo, I'm going to explore the Cook County Assessor's Office and other open data to learn about real estate in Chicagoland.
